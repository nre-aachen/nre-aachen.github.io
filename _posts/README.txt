Our dynamic content, so to speak. Just create a new in Markdown or HTML file (or any other format if the proper converter is installed) with an YAML Front Matter. The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: “YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP”, example: “2016-07-14-we-love-nre.md”. The permalinks can be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are determined solely by the file name.
