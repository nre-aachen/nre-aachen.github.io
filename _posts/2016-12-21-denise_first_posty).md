Christmas is approaching fast and everyone is somewhat stressed. To lift the mood a little bit I post this Christmas slogan, which I found recently.

The four stages of life,
You believe in Santa Claus,
You don't believe in Santa Claus,
You become Santa Claus,
You look like Santa Claus.


In that sense, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
