                <p>GeMpy is an open source project for the generation of 3D structural geological modelling. The
                    algorithm is based on a especial type of Universal cokrigin interpolation created by Laujaunie
                    et al (1997) and developed along the past years by (add many more papers!). This tool allows
                    the generation of models with relative complex structures just from data.</p>

                <h3>A Segmentation Approach for Stochastic Geological Modeling using Hidden Markov Random Fields</h3>
                <p>
                Stochastic modeling methods and uncertainty quantification are
                important tools for gaining insight into the geological variability of
                subsurface structures. Previous attempts at geologic inversion and
                interpretation can be broadly categorized into geostatistics and
                process-based modeling. The choice of a suitable modeling technique
                directly depends on the modeling applications and the available input
                data. Modern geophysical techniques provide us with regional data sets
                in two- or three-dimensional spaces with high resolution either
                directly from sensors or indirectly from geophysical inversion.
                Existing methods suffer certain drawbacks in producing accurate and
                precise (with quantified uncertainty) geological models using these
                data sets. In this work, a stochastic modeling framework is proposed
                to extract the subsurface heterogeneity from multiple and
                complementary types of data. Subsurface heterogeneity is considered as
                the “hidden link” between multiple spatial data sets. Hidden Markov
                random field models are employed to perform three-dimensional
                segmentation, which is the representation of the “hidden link”. Finite
                Gaussian mixture models are adopted to characterize the statistical
                parameters of multiple data sets. The uncertainties are simulated via
                a Gibbs sampling process within a Bayesian inference framework. The
                proposed modeling method is validated and is demonstrated using
                numerical examples. It is shown that the proposed stochastic modeling
                framework is a promising tool for three-dimensional segmentation in
                the field of geological modeling and geophysics.

                <h3>Usage of the Reduced Basis Method and High-Performance Simulations in Geosciences</h3>
                <p>
                The field of Computational Geosciences often encounters the "curse" of
                dimensionality, since it aims at analyzing complex coupled processes
                over a large domain in space and time. These high dimensional problems
                are computational intensive requiring High-Performance Computing
                infrastructures. However, constructing parallelized problems is often
                not trivial. Therefore, we present a software implementation within
                the Multiphysics Object-Orientated Simulation Environment (MOOSE)
                offering a built-in parallelization.</p>

                <p>Even with the computational potential of High-Performance Computers,
                it may be prohibitive to perform model calibrations or inversions for
                a reasonably large number of parameters, since the geoscientific
                forward simulations can be very demanding. Hence, one desires a method
                reducing the dimensionality of the problem while retaining the
                accuracy within a certain tolerance. Considering, Model Order
                Reduction Techniques is a way to achieve this.
                    </p>
                <p>We present the Reduced Basis (RB) Approximation being such a Model
                Order Reduction Technique aiming at largely reducing the number of
                degrees of freedom. Showing how the reduction in the dimension results
                in a significant speed-up, which in turn allows one to perform
                sensitivity analyses and parameter estimations, to analyze more
                complicated structures, or to get results in real- time. In order to
                demonstrate the powerful combination of the Reduced Basis Method and
                High-Performance Computing, we introduce the concepts of scalability
                and parallel efficiency two measurements for the performance of
                clusters by using the example of a geothermal conduction problem.
