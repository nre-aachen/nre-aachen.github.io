Drafts are unpublished posts without a date. The format of these files is without a date: “title.MARKUP” To preview our site with drafts, simply run “jekyll serve” or “jekyll build” with the “—drafts” switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.
